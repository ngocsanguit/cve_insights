# CVE Insights


## Introduction
CVE Insights is an application designed to streamline the process of monitoring and analyzing CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) data. It enables users to download CVE data in JSON format directly from the NVD (National Vulnerability Database) at [https://services.nvd.nist.gov](https://services.nvd.nist.gov).

## Key Features
- **Data Download**: Automates the download of CVE data from NVD in JSON format.
- **Customizable Interval**: Allows users to set custom intervals for data retrieval to stay updated with the latest CVE information.
- **Inventory Lookup**: Provides an inventory lookup file that follows the CPE (Common Platform Enumeration) naming standard. This feature is particularly useful for tailored monitoring and alerting related to specific vendors and products.
